The Discrete Structure course has been a key part of building my understanding of problem-solving in computer science. I learned about topics like set theory, logic, and proof techniques, which help in breaking down and solving problems step by step.

One of the most interesting parts was graph theory, where I explored concepts like shortest paths and connectivity that apply to real-world systems like networks and navigation. Although some topics, like recursion and proofs, were challenging at first, they became easier with practice.

This course has helped me think more logically and systematically, giving me a strong foundation for more advanced studies in computer science.
