when i first started this course, i honestly didn’t know what to expect. the name itself sounded a bit intimidating. but as we went through the topics, i realized how foundational discrete structure is, not just for computer science but for problem-solving in general.

one of the things i appreciated the most was how logical everything felt. topics like set theory, logic, and proof techniques were like building blocks, helping me think more clearly and systematically. at first, truth tables and logical equivalences were challenging, but with practice, they started to make sense—and i even started enjoying solving them.

graph theory stood out to me because it felt very applicable to the real world. understanding things like shortest paths or connectivity made me realize how these concepts are used in things like navigation apps or even social networks.

i won’t lie, there were tough moments. learning recursion, for example, was a bit of a mental workout. sometimes, it felt like i was stuck in an infinite loop trying to understand how a problem was broken down into smaller parts. but eventually, i got there—and that "aha" moment felt great.

more than anything, this course taught me patience and the importance of breaking problems into smaller, manageable pieces. it also showed me that making mistakes is part of the process—as long as i keep trying, i’ll eventually figure things out.
